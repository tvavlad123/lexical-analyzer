# lexical-analyzer
A lexical analyzer written in Python for java code (also working for C, C++  and other programming languages if adjusted).

The program has two outputs: a symbol table for identifiers & constants and the program internal form used in the first step
of compilation. For the symbol table, AVL trees are used --> 0(log n) search and insert.
